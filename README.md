# Olympic Medals Table

This is a coding challenge for BÃ³ to create a simple interface by which the user can enter a country name and the
number of medals (gold, silver, and bronze) won at the last Olympics, to be displayed in a table.

## The Task

* Countries to be added to a table, along with the TOTAL number of medals the country won during the last Olympic Games
* Rows to be sorted in descending order of medals won, either automatically or manually by the user
* (optional) Add counts for each type of medal (Gold, Silver, Bronze) and make the countries order by Gold first,
  Silver next and Bronze thereafter
* (optional) Add country flag icons/images to the country names
* Allow editing and/or deleting of countries from the list

## How to use

This is the standard bit about doing `npm install`, `npm start`, and `npm build` (or the `yarn` alternatives).
No need, really, to elaborate.

I've hosted the app on https://olympic-medals-table.surge.sh/ if you want to kick the tyres and take the app for a spin.

## What I might do differently

* Testing, testing, testing!  Normally I would have thorough test coverage, perhaps take a TDD (test-first) approach,
  but due to time constraints I just churned out the code.

* I haven't added loading and error states. I really should.
